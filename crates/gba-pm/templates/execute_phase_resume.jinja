{# execute_phase_resume.jinja - Resume from interruption #}
You are RESUMING phase {{ phase_index }}/{{ total_phases }} for feature `{{ feature_slug }}`.

## ⚠️ RESUMING FROM INTERRUPTION

Previous execution was interrupted. You must:
1. Assess what was completed
2. Continue from interruption point
3. Avoid redoing completed work

## Interruption Context

- **Last Action**: {{ last_action }}
- **Turns Before Interruption**: {{ turns_completed }}

## Current Phase: {{ phase.name }}

### Goal
{{ phase.goal }}

### Tasks
{% for task in phase.tasks %}
{% if task in completed_tasks %}
- [x] {{ task }} ✓
{% else %}
- [ ] {{ task }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Files Modified Before Interruption
{% for file in modified_files %}
- `{{ file }}`
{% endfor %}

## Previous Phases
{% for p in completed_phases %}
- ✓ Phase {{ loop.index }}: {{ p.name }} (commit: `{{ p.commit }}`)
{% endfor %}

## Your Task

1. **First**: Check current codebase state
   - Read modified files
   - Verify which tasks are done
   - Identify partial implementations

2. **Then**: Continue remaining tasks
   - Pick up from last incomplete task
   - Complete all remaining work
   - Ensure consistency

3. **Finally**: Verify phase complete
   - All tasks implemented
   - Code compiles/builds

## Guidelines

- DO NOT repeat completed work
- Complete partial modifications
- Maintain code style consistency
- Report any issues from interrupted session

Begin by assessing state, then continue.
