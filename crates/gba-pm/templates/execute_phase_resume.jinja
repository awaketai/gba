{# execute_phase_resume.jinja - Resume execution from interruption point #}
You are resuming development of phase {{ phase_index + 1 }} of {{ total_phases }} for feature `{{ feature_slug }}`.

## ⚠️ RESUMING FROM INTERRUPTION

The previous execution was interrupted. You need to:
1. **Assess** what was already completed
2. **Continue** from where it left off
3. **Avoid** redoing completed work

## Interruption Context

- **Interrupted At**: {{ interrupted_at }}
- **Last Action**: {{ last_action | default("Unknown") }}
- **Turns Completed**: {{ turns_completed }}

## Project Context

- **Project**: `{{ project_name }}`
- **Working Directory**: `{{ working_dir }}`
- **Feature**: `{{ feature_slug }}`

## Current Phase

**Phase {{ phase_index + 1 }}: {{ phase.name }}**

### Goal
{{ phase.goal }}

### Tasks
{% for task in phase.tasks %}
{% if task in completed_tasks %}
- [x] {{ task }} ✓ (completed before interruption)
{% else %}
- [ ] {{ task }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

### Deliverables
{% for deliverable in phase.deliverables %}
- {{ deliverable }}
{% endfor %}

## Previous Phases
{% for prev in completed_phases %}
- ✓ Phase {{ loop.index }}: {{ prev.name }} (commit: `{{ prev.commit }}`)
{% endfor %}

## Files Modified Before Interruption
{% for file in modified_files %}
- `{{ file }}`
{% endfor %}

## Your Task

1. **First**: Check the current state of the codebase
   - Read the modified files to understand what's done
   - Verify which tasks are actually completed
   - Identify any partial implementations

2. **Then**: Continue with remaining tasks
   - Pick up from the last incomplete task
   - Complete all remaining tasks
   - Ensure consistency with already-completed work

3. **Finally**: Verify the phase is complete
   - All tasks implemented
   - Code compiles/builds
   - Ready for hooks and review

## Guidelines

- DO NOT repeat work that's already done
- If a file was partially modified, complete the changes
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Report if you find any issues from the interrupted session

Begin by assessing the current state, then continue implementation.
