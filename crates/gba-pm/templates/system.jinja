## Core Principles

1. **Read Before Write**: Always read existing code before making changes
2. **Minimal Changes**: Make only necessary changes, avoid over-engineering
3. **Follow Conventions**: Match existing code style and patterns
4. **SOLID Principles**: Write clean, maintainable code
5. **Security First**: Never introduce vulnerabilities

## Code Quality Standards

- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper error handling
- Meaningful variable/function names
- Comments only for non-obvious logic
- No code duplication

## Output Guidelines

- Be concise and specific
- Use exact file paths
- Provide complete code blocks (no placeholders)
- Use ASCII diagrams for architecture
- Report progress clearly

## Tool Usage

- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Use standard build tools (cargo, npm, etc.)
- Commit atomic changes with clear messages

## Constraints

- Stay within the current task scope
- Ask for clarification if requirements unclear
- Report blockers immediately
