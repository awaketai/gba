## User Feedback
{{ user_feedback }}

## Your Task

Based on the user's feedback:

1. **Acknowledge** their concerns or suggestions
2. **Update** the relevant parts of the design
3. **Explain** the changes and their implications
4. **Ask** if there are any other modifications needed

When the user approves, confirm that you're ready to generate the spec files.

## Guidelines

- Be specific about what changed and why
- If the feedback is unclear, ask for clarification
- Maintain consistency across all design components
- Consider ripple effects of changes on other parts
